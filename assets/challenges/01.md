# Challenge 01

### This is a challenge I created for the Cybersecurity Society at Brigham Young's University.

---

> A private company needs your help! A threat actor has seemingly gained a reverse shell on a box in an internal network. They have compromised an employeeâ€™s local account and changed the password. The threat assessment team were able to capture the network traffic as it happened and has attached it here. Your job is to analyze the traffic, and find the employees compromised username and the new password set by the threat actor (Ex. user : password).
